# Decentralized Medical Device Tracking

## Overview

The Decentralized Medical Device Tracking platform leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent system for tracking medical devices throughout their entire lifecycle. From manufacturing verification to end-of-life disposal, this solution ensures patient safety, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency across the healthcare ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Manufacturer Verification Contract
Validates legitimate device producers through a comprehensive verification process that includes regulatory compliance checks, quality management system assessment, and production facility certification. This contract creates a trusted registry of authorized manufacturers, reducing the risk of counterfeit or substandard devices entering the supply chain. Each verified manufacturer receives a unique digital identity on the blockchain that serves as the foundation for product authenticity.

### Product Registration Contract
Records details of medical equipment including device identifiers (UDI), specifications, component materials, manufacturing date, batch/lot numbers, and expiration dates. The contract creates a digital birth certificate for each device, establishing its provenance and enabling full traceability. Critical safety and usage information is permanently linked to each device record, ensuring this data remains accessible throughout the device's lifetime.

### Distribution Tracking Contract
Monitors movement through supply chain by recording each transfer of custody from manufacturer to distributor to healthcare provider. The contract verifies authorized handling at each stage, tracks storage conditions through integrated IoT sensors, and alerts stakeholders about deviations from required parameters (temperature, humidity, etc.). This creates an auditable chain of custody that helps prevent diversion and ensures proper handling.

### Service History Contract
Documents maintenance and repairs over time, creating a comprehensive service record for each device. The contract records scheduled maintenance, calibration activities, firmware updates, parts replacements, and repair history. By maintaining this information on the blockchain, all stakeholders gain visibility into the current state and service history of every device, supporting better maintenance planning and regulatory compliance.

## Benefits

## Technical Architecture

The platform utilizes a hybrid blockchain approach that balances privacy requirements with transparency needs. Private data remains encrypted and accessible only to authorized parties, while public verification of device authenticity and status is available to all stakeholders.

## Getting Started

### For Manufacturers
1. Complete manufacturer verification process
2. Register devices at point of production
3. Track distribution through authorized channels
4. Access real-time data on device location and status

### For Healthcare Providers
1. Verify device authenticity upon receipt
2. Track device usage and maintenance within facilities
3. Access comprehensive device history and documentation
4. Receive automated alerts for maintenance and recalls

## Security and Compliance

The platform is designed for compliance with global medical device regulations including FDA UDI requirements, EU MDR, and ISO 13485 standards. Rigorous security measures protect sensitive data while maintaining the transparency benefits of blockchain technology.
